Support Notes
--------------

Tested with Matlab 2010b on WindowsXPSP3 32-bit
Tested with Matlab 2010b+ on Windows7 64-bit (all execpt DAQ toolbox)


Requirements: 

For use of the DiscriminantAnalysis SignalAnalysis Classifier modules
Statistics Toolbox


For use of the DaqHwDevice input object
Data Acquisition Toolbox.  See http://www.mathworks.com/products/daq/requirements.html

Data acquisition toolbox notes:
* For external DAQ devices, these typically require third party driver software.  

* Measurement Computing products need the InstaCal driver software installed.  
  Channel modes (e.g. differential versus single ended) should be configured with that tool

* National Instruments board require the nidaqMX driver suite, available from the NI website
  The complete install package is ~1.5GB, however you can alternatively download and install
  the nidaqmx_core library which is only ~150 MB

* Important: Please follow the instructions for registering the install DAQ device with the 
  MATLAB environment.  This typically takes the form:
  >> daqregister('nidaq')  % RUN AFTER LAUNCHING MATLAB IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE
