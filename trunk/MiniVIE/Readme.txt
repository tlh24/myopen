MiniVIE

The MiniVIE is a package library based on the Johns Hopkins University 
Applied Physics Laboratory Virtual Integration Environment (JHU/APL VIE).
This is a completely seperate and independent code base that is designed to 
take the modularity and themes of the VIE and make them readily accessible.

The most interesting things you can do with this code base requires data acquisition
hardware to get EMG or similar signals into the environment.  However, a basic signal
simulator exists and can be used to test the functionality.

Use the MiniVIE script as a tutorial guide to see how the modules are created and 
interact with one another.

Good Luck!
