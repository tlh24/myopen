% convert spike_ts to real units (wall clock)

% given the packetization, might want to apply a variable 
% delay based on where in the frame it is. 
% e.g. first packet in a frame will be delayed by almost a full frame time;
% last will be delayed by frame time * frame duty-cycle.
% will have to record packet number ...
