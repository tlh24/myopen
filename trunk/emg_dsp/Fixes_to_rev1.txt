Things that we want to fix for next time: 
* put a little dot on the silkscreen to incicate component orientation. 
* FCI USB-B connector has the wrong PCB footprint (digikey 609-1039-ND)
** need: 609-1045-ND !!! (that is, a type-A connector)
* Get correct size for 33uh inductor.  (L5) suggestion: 495-1761-1-ND 
(1812 case, not great DC resistance but ehwell, it is narrow enough.
* dot between pads of 0402s (or box around them)
* dot by diode (or line!)

Fixes to the board:
* Dout3 should go to DR1SEC not DR0SEC !!! (fixable on the board with a jumper)
* label "MISO" was deleted from U4 (74LCX541) pin 7 (a6).  should be connected to nordic
	pin #6 (after the 25 ohm resistor). 
* pin 6 on the CAT32TDI is not connected to Vbat. 
	should not be connected to Vdd - too much current (50ma @ 7v )
	for the switching regulator to start! 
* use SN74LV595A, not 594A. 
* SN74LV595A is mislabeled -- OE should be tied to the inverse of reset, so that it 
	is normally enabled. Or, OE should be tied to ground. 
* bring the LCD signals out for probing... 
* use TFS0 to control the LCD _cs signal
* use larger holes around the perimeter, e.g. 7/64 for 4-40 screws.
