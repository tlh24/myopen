errors in the schematic
1 - DR1PRI is not brought out, who knows why... but it looks okay.

notes from debugging stage5. 

August 3 2010 -- 
	Got it booting to USB; no serial port as I bought the wrong ADUM3202 package.
	The secret is to disable Vcc - processor internal voltage - while programming!
		(should have thought of this before)
	seems quite a bit of current is being dissipated on the 3V supply - 
	perhaps there is a short somewhere? 
	seems more likely to be an open circuit than short, as the solder paste volumes with the 
	Pololu stencils are small. 
	Hmm. What is connected to that net?  Just the RHA2116s - perhaps I've got them 
	hooked wrong, and a diode somewhere is dissipating the current? 
	Let's see if the power disipation is within spec. 
	it's dropping ~ 1.75V.  Each RHA2116 should dissipate 5mw -> 
	10mw, or 3.3mA.  say 3.5mA.  the regulator should hence be dissipating 6mw. 
	It is almost certainly dissipating much more than that!  why? 
	Also, the gain seems low. 
	
	Another mystery - DR1SEC is oscillating.  It should be driven by the ADC7476.  wha? 
	(oscillations perhaps because of a bad ball connection below the blackfin?)
	Checked it again, and it looks okay - there is an error in the schemactic, noted above.
