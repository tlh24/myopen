errors in the schematic
1 - DR1PRI is not brought out, who knows why... but it looks okay.
2 - no electrolytic capacitor needed.  battery + ceramic is good enough.

notes from debugging stage5. 

August 3 2010 -- 
	Got it booting to USB; no serial port as I bought the wrong ADUM3202 package.
	The secret is to disable Vcc - processor internal voltage - while programming!
		(should have thought of this before)
	seems quite a bit of current is being dissipated on the 3V supply - 
	perhaps there is a short somewhere? 
	seems more likely to be an open circuit than short, as the solder paste volumes with the 
	Pololu stencils are small. 
	Hmm. What is connected to that net?  Just the RHA2116s - perhaps I've got them 
	hooked wrong, and a diode somewhere is dissipating the current? 
	Let's see if the power disipation is within spec. 
	it's dropping ~ 1.75V.  Each RHA2116 should dissipate 5mw -> 
	10mw, or 3.3mA.  say 3.5mA.  the regulator should hence be dissipating 6mw. 
	It is almost certainly dissipating much more than that!  why? 
	Also, the gain seems low. 
	
	Another mystery - DR1SEC is oscillating.  It should be driven by the ADC7476.  wha? 
	(oscillations perhaps because of a bad ball connection below the blackfin?)
	Checked it again, and it looks okay - there is an error in the schemactic, noted above.
August 4 2010 --
	Intan chips still consuming too much current. Tried reflowing them, 
	no clear change.  Also reflowed the blackfin; seem to have resolved some open 
	ckts there.  
	Intan chips - specifically the 3.0V LDO - get hot independent of the presence 
	of Vcc or Vdd.  (1.2 and 2.85v, respectively).  
	One thing to note: I think it's isolated to the bottom chip. The top chip shows normal 
	bias voltages across the three bandwidth-setting resistors. 
	I'm going to ignore the bottom chip and work only with the top one. 
	So: let's get the wireless working. 
	no, no, first get clean samples from the headstage. 
August 7 2010 --
	Removed the bottom intan chip.  3V LDO no longer dissipating tons of heat = good. 
	I seems that many of the inputs to the intan chip were not connected - 
	Namely pins 1-10, excluding pin 9. 
	Hence, only DVdd and DGnd were set - which is why the chip was heating up so much. 
		(This implies that the other chip may have open-circuits underneath, too!)
	Still have strange sampling-locked noise on the input of the ADC. 
	According to the schematic and layout, there shouldn't be anything else connected
	to the muc pin - ??
	The input to the ADC is a square wave that goes high the instant RFS goes high, 
	and falls 6.4us later - about 3 bits before the conversion is done. 
	Perhaps the ADC is a bit broken... ? e.g. there is leakage when the track circuit is enabled?
	Bottom ADC shows the same waveform, but it's not connected to anything. 
	----
	Anyway, input referred noise, with the input hooked to the plexon artificial rat
	is 10uV RMS.  This was measured by recording via USB, lowpass filtering to 5khz 
	(sampling rate set to 100ksps), and taking the std. I think this is reasonable?
	----
	Supply voltage are all close enough to not turn on any ESD protection diodes, I think. 
	RHA2116 is at 3.018V. 
	ADC is at 2.701V
	Blackfin is at 2.872V. 
	The biggest difference is between the ADC and RHA2116, which is still only 300mV - 
	and the connection between them is just signal and ground. 
	----
	Let's test the gain. Input signal 4.5V pk-pk.  after plexon -> 450uV pk-pk. 
	hum.  I don't see a sine wave. that's not good. 
	Yea, I can't find the signal via fft, either, though it seems to be there on the 'scope. 
		(with a good bit of noise from the sampling-locked noise mentioned above). 
	The noise amplitude is about 100mV; the signal amplitude is approximately the same. 
	Input-referred, that's 500uV, okay, chip is probably working. 
	the SCK signal seems to be coupled to the input of the ADC, with 
	the ADC off (no clock or frame sync) and the muliplexer off (no step signal). 
	Let's look at the layout for that. 
	There is no good reason for the two to be connected - 
		they are not so close together in the layout; must be connected through input amplification?
	This appears to have been a result of an open connection on the board.
	----
	Reflowed the board, put the 'broken' RHA2116 back on - now it seems to work. 
	Unfortunately, the omentics connector fell off in the process. 
	The problem is clearly the SOLDER PASTE- too little, and it does not wet the devices well 
	(the nRF24L01 may have some open circuits, and it's interfereing with the flash - 
		could try reflowing that if i want to destroy more shit)
August 9 2010 --
	reflowed the radio. board does not even get past the manufacturer ID without nRF24L01
	on there!  Radio does, however, seem to be soldered corectly - at least now. 
	reflowed the blackfin, again; perhaps there is a cold joint, but all pads and balls 
	appeared to have solder / solder paste, so there (theoretically) should be no open-circuits. 
	there is also the possibility that traces within the board are broken; will need to make another.
	----
	blackfin shorts Vdd. removed it; observed too much solder paste under the balls. 
	will have to decrease apeture of associated solder paste mask.
	behavior of the board without blackfin: still errors in writing the flash. 
	specifically, the last segment of the first page is all zeros. 
	modified the program, and now get the stuck-byte problem: same byte is written to flash
	(or read from flash) for many memory locations in a row. 
	Looks like it's a memory read error - the pattern changes with two serial reads, 
	though the error seems to start around the same point.
	Weird, I do it again, and the read seems repeatable, with only 2 errors - and the errors are 
	consistent. 
	And now it all works ??!! what the?  Must be a flaky connection somewhere. 
	Perhaps the level translators? hmm. Flah voltage is correct, in any case. 
	-----
	Trying to test communications in the simplest way possible - requesting the flash to ID itself, 
	over and over agian. 
	At first, it wouldn't work, but now it's quite reliable. WHY??
	It looks like interupptions to the power are sufficient to cause strange and undesired response
	post-query - let me try removing the electrolytic.
	YES that fixed it.  why, oh so why? 
	Also to note: 
	* removed printf statements during program sequences. 
	* I killed X.
	Need to mantain constant clock rate!! 
	Now, put the blackfin back on there, I guess.
	Done.  works!  comes up as /dev/ttyUSB0 !
	Both Intan chips appear to be working, despite all the reheating I've done to them! 
	----
	Next, to measure the signal and noise quality of the digitized data. 
	Don't have an omnetics connector on there - in a box, it's 23uV RMS noise.
	Not too bad for no input and possible contamination from USB. 
	need to test this with input shorted, I guess. Or, better, a real input.
