Fixes to stage9: 
* Need to have a hole or somethingunder the 9-pin omnetics conmnectors: 
	connectros shear off easily
	Alternately, need a different connector system. 
* Bipolar transitor on the input to prevnt breaking in the case the battery polarity is wrong
* Lower voltage (0.85v) , lower clock rate w/ simpler firmware
* Use cuts not jumpers for the ground / reference configuration. 
** Slight ground currents should not matter, I hope. Need to think about this. 
* Realy should use the impedance measurement -- should be a very useful feature. 
* Also, an accelerometer or some other way of measuring state ... will have to transmit that
** can multiplex on one continuous channel.
* LFP would be nice too. Expand the analog filtering? 
* Might be nice to use something else to derive the MUX signals, and do block computation? 
	Have to think about this .. issue is that we are wasting clocks sometimes waiting for samples.
	Really need a much lower-power processor. 
* Add 2-4 channels microstim(?).  Must be careful about ground-loop: use a separate proc. 
	or a separate battery; have to think about this.
