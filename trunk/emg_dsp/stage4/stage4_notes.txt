1.  Feb 26 2010 - Testing the 74HC467 to see if it will switch quick enough to 
	multiplex for the neural headstage at low supply voltage; the datasheet warns 
	that the switches are very nonlinear at low voltage, but nonlinear is OK
	so long as the output settles to steady stage in time for the ADC to sample. 
	Anyway, to sample 16 channels at 50ksps each, need to switch at 800kHz. 
	First, we test at 3.15V (two AA batteries)
	Set my function generator to that -> looks good, especially to ground. 
	The slew rate is actually higher than that from my function gen!
	Should test to Vcc/2, since per the spec sheet that appears to be the area 
	where the multiplexing switches are the most nonlinear. 
	With one input to the multiplexer at 0 and one at 1.5V, there is about 75ns
	of ringing on the output/common line. Not too bad! 
	Now, test at 2.45V (one alkaline and one NiMH battery): 
	Still looks good!  There is about 75ns of delay, but little ringing, and the signal
	seems to settle to the steady point very quickly. 
	Indeed, the multiplexer seems to behave well even with the address lines
	toggled at 2MHz.  I wouldn't use it that high, though.  
	Slew rate at Vdd=3.15V about 1.5v/20ns; @ Vdd=2.45V about 0.8v/20ns.
	----
	Conclusion: NXP's 74HC467 will work well at 2.7V multiplexing signals
	with the address lines changing at 800kHz. 
	
2. March 30 2010 - The Shutdown (SD) pin on the MAX253 is not driven - 
	Should be connected to ground, or so. 
3. All the voltages seem to come up correctly (after I reflowed the damn little 
	TPS62410 - internal short to center pad).  Next, thes out the microstim channels? 
	Or try flashing the device?  need usb.h in svn!!
4. Processor does not boot - no data on MISO lines.  (There is data on MOSI and SCK)
	PF2 is high - why? perhaps a short somewhere? 
	hmm... after a bit of probing, it seems the proc is booting! 
	(maybe I disloged some bit of old solder paste?)
	and the serial port is also working.  horray!  can use this for debugging. 
5. Next thing, I think, is to get USB working, then maybe write a stim program. 
	Nah, let's check the AFE. 
	Looks like something is shorting the output of V18 LDO -- it's only ~287mV. 
	Trying to reflow the thing -- better be careful though! 
	Hmm.  These chips are really hard to work with ... but managed to fix the problem by 
	removing mis-placed chips & applying current. 
6. Check the gain:  4.5V in -> 450uv -> 1.5V out :: gain = 3k.  hmm, a bit high. 
	Well, anyway, the multiplexer works - at least a few channels of it.
