fixes to stage3: 
1. 74LVC2G04 ... wrong footprint/package.  ordered part too small. 
	Need SOT-23-6; ordered SC-70-6 
	correct PN is SN74LVC2G04DBVR
2. Audio jack footprint inverted - jack needs to be mounted on the bottom of the board! 
3. AD8220 has the wrong footprint.  It only comes in MSOP-8; 
	used SOIC-8 on the board.
