fixes to stage3: 
1. Audio jack footprint inverted - jack needs to be mounted on the bottom of the board! 
2. AD8220 has the wrong footprint.  It only comes in MSOP-8; 
	used SOIC-8 on the board. 

notes on operation of stage3: 
* stage3 was designed to test 6 different instrumentation amplifiers' ability and performance
	in amplifying surface electromyography (sEMG) using dry electrodes. 
* all instrumentation amplifiers were set to a gain of 10 (or so); 100 was far too much, 
	it would cause the amps to saturate. Besides, the purpose of the INA is to reject common
	mode and transform the impedance (probably, mismatched source impedance.)
* Electrode to skin contact matters more than INA choice, to a large extent. 
	With low-impedance gel electrodes, all amps performed well. 
	High impedance electrodes - here just Grass gold-plated cups, dry no gel, 
	held to my skin with "Elastickon" elastic tape - are a challenge to record sEMGs, 
	but we consider that the consumer will poorly accept sticky, hard-to remove 
	electrodes - especially those that leave a mark (AgCl).  These dry electrodes 
	must be pressed to the skin rather firmly to get decent recordings. 
* With dry electrodes, microphonic noise is often far larger than the EMG signal.
	May have to put the INAs right next to the electrodes & muscle - more expensive, 
	but (probably, have to test) better quality. 
* In these experiments, dry cup electrodes took some time to 'warm up' -- 
	I presume sweat lowers the contact restistance to the skin.  
	Need to make the electrodes more reliable than that. 

1. INA331 needs to have an initial gain of 5 or 10 to work properly with the feedback 
	to the ref electrode.  Otherwise, it gets stuck on a rail. 
	With lower gain it works quite well - though is very very sensitive to AM radio 
	and phones ringing etc. Background noise of this INA is less than MAX4208, 
	but this doesn't matter as AM signals corrupt the response.  (This was 
	the best AM radio of the bunch of INAs - probably because of some nonlinear protection
	elements in the input, and larger bandwidth.  Couldn't have discovered this from 
	the spec sheet!)
2. MAX4208 works ok at G=100, though it is easily saturated by movement artifact.  
	A slightly higher initial high-pass filter may be warranted. 
	2.1 Changed the gain to ~10, it works much much better.  Better than INA116 and INA331.
		There is still a ton of microphonic noise, though. 
	2.2 changed the feedback cap from 220 pf to 1.5nf.  noticable decrease in bandwidth ; 
		I think that 1.5nf is too high.  It does kill the noise, though! 
		I would estimate that somewhere around 500pf with 330k/27k feedback restistors 
		would work well. (tested this, seems ok!)
	2.3  The output of this amp was cleaner, but yet still I feel it's missing part of the signal - 
		There is a certain 'flutter' to the EMG (as subjectively judged through headphones)
		that the Analog Device's INAs 'capture' (or create?) that the Maxim chip does not have. 
		I should test the bandwidth of these devices, maybe. 
	2.4 Tried with mismatched electrode impedance - one wet gel, one dry cup - still worked ok. 
	** I now feel that this is the best of the lot - cheap, works well, simplest circuit
	(just ground referenced, no integrator-stabilized ref pin). 
3. INA116 - good, but not as impressive as I might have expected.  
	Changed the gain to 10; was 100.  
	Too expensive for our application, and the femto-amp input current does not seem to buy 
	that much - see mismatched source test above. 
4. AD8236 is sensitive to saturation in the high gain config again.
	With the gain reset to 10, i still was not impressed - AD8221 was better. 
	Given good electrode contact, the DRL circuit seems to work... but again I'm 
	not sure how much this buys, and it doesn't scale well to many channels (which one
	should drive the DRL?)
	With a gain of about 10, it has worse noise-rejection than MAX4208, 
	even with lower-impedance wet electrodes and the DRL circuit. 
5. AD8221AR is better than the AD8236.  With DRL, wet electrodes, and gain changed to 12, 
	may be better than MAX4208, or just about the same. 
	With good electrode contacts DRL does not improve the signal that much. 
	Same CMRR as MAX4202, empirically... maybe a bit more high-freq noise. 
	More suceptible to AM demodulation that the AD8220.
	As mentioned above, captures a 'flutter' in the EMG signal that Maxim's chip does not -
	but perhaps this is an artifact?  I can't imagine a biological source of this signal.
6. AD8220BA with lower impedance electrodes seems to work quite well - little 60hz noise
	despite the gain of 100. indeed, high gain means it is much better at picking up 
	muscle tone.  
	I think that AD8220 may be slightly better at picking up resting or slight muscle tone
	than MAX4208, but MAX4208 has lower 60Hz noise, and with the feedback cap optimized, 
	about the same background noise.  
	
Rank ordering : 
# MAX4208
	## cheapest. 
	## simplest circuit. 
	## best CMRR. 
	## good source-impedance mismatch rejection. 
	## small package. 
	## 750ua current consumption - but OK. 
	## available (from Maxim directly)
	## best compromise of all criteria. 
# AD8220A
	## best subjective EMG quality, as judged through headphones. 
	## small pkg. 
	## good 60hz interference rejection.  
	## low background noise, lowest of the lot. (60hz + AM radio + intrinsic). 
	## very high input impedance. 
	## 750ua .. current consumption - again, ok. 
# AD8221
	## about the same as AD8220, except a better AM demodulator. (more bandwidth)
	## low intrinsic noise. 
	## slightly higher current consumption - 1ma. 
# AD8236
	## cheaper than other Analog Devices, but:
	## worse noise rejection
# INA331
	## worked quite well provided you shield from possible RF interference. 
	## rather cheap. 
	## not as good CMRR at higher frequencies. 
# INA116 
	## Even though it has almost no input bias current, and very good CMRR, 
	it's too expensive and large.  
	
	
	
for the microstimulator: 
1. 74LVC2G04 ... wrong footprint/package.  ordered part too small. 
	Need SOT-23-6; ordered SC-70-6 
	correct PN is SN74LVC2G04DBVR
2. Vbias can be 5.5 V - seems to work fine. 
3. Need 100pf slew-rate limiting capacitor.
4. Ground plane is fine, with the 100pf cap the output shows very little ringing. (~4us)
5. Monitoring circuit is fine too. 
6. Should add emitter resistors to the bottom side current mirror. 
7. There is turn-off transient - topside PNPs take longer to turn off than bottomside NPN. 
	This should be fixed. 
	Tried adding a 47pf cap to the output-NPN base charge dissipating transistor, 
	but it actually had a /negative/ effect on the residual voltgage. 
8.  Should test it with an inductive load (e.g. long wires). 
	Tried it with ethernet cable - seems more capacitive than inductive with such a 
	large 'termination' impedance.  ethernet is 50 ohms, no.. ? 
	have to review my transmission line theory. 
	Anyway, the capacitive term dominates, so should try to minimize this 
	(e.g. 300 ohm line?)
