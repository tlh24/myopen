fixes to stage3: 
1. 74LVC2G04 ... wrong footprint/package.  ordered part too small. 
	Need SOT-23-6; ordered SC-70-6 
	correct PN is SN74LVC2G04DBVR
2. Audio jack footprint inverted - jack needs to be mounted on the bottom of the board! 
3. AD8220 has the wrong footprint.  It only comes in MSOP-8; 
	used SOIC-8 on the board. 
	
	
for the microstimulator: 
1. Vbias can be 5.5 V - seems to work fine. 
2. Need 100pf slew-rate limiting capacitor.
3. Ground plane is fine, with the 100pf cap the output shows very little ringing. (~4us)
4. Monitoring circuit is fine too. 
5. Should add emitter resistors to the bottom side current mirror. 
6. There is turn-off transient - topside PNPs take longer to turn off than bottomside NPN. 
	This should be fixed. 
	Tried adding a 47pf cap to the output-NPN base charge dissipating transistor, 
	but it actually had a /negative/ effect on the residual voltgage. 
7.  Should test it with an inductive load (e.g. long wires). 
	Tried it with ethernet cable - seems more capacitive than inductive with such a 
	large 'termination' impedance.  ethernet is 50 ohms, no.. ? 
	have to review my transmission line theory. 
	Anyway, the capacitive term dominates, so should try to minimize this 
	(e.g. 300 ohm line?)
