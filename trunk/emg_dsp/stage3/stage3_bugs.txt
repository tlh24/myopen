fixes to stage3: 
1. 74LVC2G04 ... wrong footprint/package.  ordered part too small. 
	Need SOT-23-6; ordered SC-70-6 
	correct PN is SN74LVC2G04DBVR
2. Audio jack footprint inverted - jack needs to be mounted on the bottom of the board! 
3. AD8220 has the wrong footprint.  It only comes in MSOP-8; 
	used SOIC-8 on the board. 

notes on operation of stage3: 
1. INA331 needs to have an initial gain of 5 to work properly with the feedback 
	to the ref electrode.  With this, it works quite well - though
	is very very sensitive to AM radio and phones ringing etc. 
	Headphone gain must be turned up to hear this, of course. 
2. MAX4208 works ok, though it is easily saturated by movement artifact.  perhaps 
	should put a high-pas filter in sooner, with less initial gain? 
	The only way to really get it to work is to firmly press the grass electrodes to my skin. 
	Right now I have them taped there with "Elastickon" elastic tape. 
	Electrode-to-skin contact seems to matter more than anything else. 
	Thuis inst amp seems to work about the same as 8236.. no, maybe better. 
	2.1 changed the gain to ~10, it works much much better.  better than INA116 and INA331.
		There is still a ton of microphonic noise, though - may have to mount the 
		Inst. apm. at the muscle. 
3. AD8236 is sensitive to saturation - again, I think the initial gain is set far too high. 
	It is also rather sensitive to electrode contact & impedance. 
	Given good contact, however, the DRL circuit seems to work... well is another story. 
	The gain is too high for really large muscular contractions - at least for my bicep w.
	Grass gold cup electrodes. 
	Need, need to get rid of the low-freq energy that saturates the amplifier. 
4. AD8221AR seems about the same as AD8236, though the noise is slightly worse, even with DRL. 
5. AD8220B doesn't seem to have as good noise-rejection as AD8236.  If the electrodes are good, 
	and the DRL is working, this functions better. But, perhaps, I messed it up somehow.
	
for the microstimulator: 
1. Vbias can be 5.5 V - seems to work fine. 
2. Need 100pf slew-rate limiting capacitor.
3. Ground plane is fine, with the 100pf cap the output shows very little ringing. (~4us)
4. Monitoring circuit is fine too. 
5. Should add emitter resistors to the bottom side current mirror. 
6. There is turn-off transient - topside PNPs take longer to turn off than bottomside NPN. 
	This should be fixed. 
	Tried adding a 47pf cap to the output-NPN base charge dissipating transistor, 
	but it actually had a /negative/ effect on the residual voltgage. 
7.  Should test it with an inductive load (e.g. long wires). 
	Tried it with ethernet cable - seems more capacitive than inductive with such a 
	large 'termination' impedance.  ethernet is 50 ohms, no.. ? 
	have to review my transmission line theory. 
	Anyway, the capacitive term dominates, so should try to minimize this 
	(e.g. 300 ohm line?)
