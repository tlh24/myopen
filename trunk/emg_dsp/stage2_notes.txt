state2 notes: 
x array distance on the LMV1023 circuit: 0.247"
y array distance : 0.057

Feb 11 2009: changed input capacitors from 1uf to 0.47uf to have 
better rejection of ECG; updating the digikey order accordingly. 

March 10 2009 - 
NEED THERMAL RELIEF around all through holes; otherwise, cannot solder them! 
(at least, not with a soldering iron; may be able to reflow them)
NEED more space around the electrolytic cap -- or need a surface mount cap. 
	 I'm just going to leave it out for now. 
NEED to get the large-bumped package for electret amps: LMV1032UR
FOOTPRINT for SOD-523 and SOD-323 are incorrect; need to use SOD-523 for both 
	on board (3.3 and 5v zener protection).

	http://www.diodes.com/zetex/_pdfs/3.0/pack/SOD323.pdf
	323 is BIGGER than 523 (wha?)
FOOTPRINT of nRF24L01 too small - fixed. 
	the top pads were off by 0.25mm !  (1.5mm instead of 1.75mm - 
	changed to 1.85mm for better exposed die clearance)
FOOTPRINT of LFCSP-48 enhanced.  should be OK now, though - just no overhang. 
	set overhang to 0.2mm. 
VOLTAGE of the MAX3421E is 3.3V - it does not run at 2.85V!! DOH! 
	next time need a 3.3v LDO off the USB power for this chip!
