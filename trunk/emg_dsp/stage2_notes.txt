state2 notes: 
x array distance on the LMV1023 circuit: 0.247"
y array distance : 0.057

Feb 11 2009: changed input capacitors from 1uf to 0.47uf to have 
better rejection of ECG; updating the digikey order accordingly. 

March 10 2009 - 
NEED thermal releif around all through holes; otherwise, cannot solder them! 
(at least, not with a soldering iron; may be able to reflow them)
NEED more space around the electrolytic cap -- or need a surface mount cap. 
	 I'm just going to leave it out for now. 
NEED to get the large-bumped package for electret amps: LMV1032UR
FOOTPRINT for SOD-523 and SOD-323 are incorrect; need to use SOD-523 for both 
	on board (3.3 and 5v zener protection).

	323 is BIGGER than 523 (wha?)
