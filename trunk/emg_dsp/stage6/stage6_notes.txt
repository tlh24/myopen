Hardware Fixes: 
	* The LEDs are TOO bright!  decrease the current to a more reasonable 
	level.  Current LEDs Vf = 2.0V :: 26mA of current. 10ma better -> 
	need 130 ohm resistors.
	Total power dissipation of 16 LEDs: 1.3W..?
	* Vdd_OTP NEEDS to be TIED TO 2.5V for the proc to boot.
	I guess I'll need a regulator here.
	(I assume this is needed by the security code)
	* Need caps on nordic lines to quench ringing (47pf, SCK & MOSI)

	* Wrote a simplified .dxe - one that just toggles a few pins - 
	and the BF527 seems to run. Next: see if we can get the SPI interface running. 
	(this will show if the SPI pins are connected - the proc does not boot, 
	but this is likely because the flash originally ordered was a 2V part)
	* putting the SDRAM in self refresh works. 
	* setting the core clock at 600Mhz and the system clock at 125Mhz 
	seems to work as well. the toggle rate is 6.666Mhz now; was 1.5Mhz.
	(I'm sure glad JTAG works!!!)
	* looks like the SPI port is working! Not sure why it doesn't try to boot..
	* Next task: get the UART working. soo useful. done.
	* SDRAM: initalized.  works, checked!  yay!
	* Ethernet: need to have a milisecond counter running first, in an interrupt.
	* Ethernet: works.  DCHP and all!

	* Next: get the radio working. Needs to be soldered there first! 
November 12 2010
	* okay, the bridge - at least in a debug build - seems to work. 
	The radio is very sensitive to timing / sequencing: notably, NRF_CE
	must be low while uploading the response (command) packet.  
	so be it.  
	* -O3 does not work, for whatever reason.  ??  just use -O or -O2.
	* if you put the headstage in oscillate mode, it still appears that there
	 are dropped packets. perhaps it is the client..?
	 the trace from UDP packets indicates that nothing is being dropped, 
	 and the o-scope similarly looks good. 
	* I guess the next thing is to try out the new version of the headstage..
