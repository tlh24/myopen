fixes to stage10: 
 * need to connect R118 to ground. This is the APD signal on the PoE chip.
 	(not absolutely needed for device function, but should be fixed.)
 * regulated output of PoE converter is 2.5v -- off by a factor of 2? 
 * Anode and cathode are reversed on the TLE431 (!)
 * Really need to have a switch on the PoE input -- so we can turn off the switching there.
