todo: 

gtkclient: 
* make sorting so that you don't have to switch all the time. (DONE)
* spike sorting does not switch modes when needed ; continues to add poly when should be moving threshold.
* this and several other errors seem to be when you have multiple of the same channel represented on the screen. (priority queue / mutex fix.)
* aperture must be set when you define the template -- almost always it seems too big, and the gui element is not updated either. 
	looks like, rather, it updates the wrong GUI spinner.
* IDEA: make the other channels correspond to the last 3 looked-at chans. (yea,can do with a queue)
* IDEA: switch the stereo output so 0 is mono, or reverse order in hardware. (DONE)
* IDEA: more nonlinear fading / faster or more adjustable fading / color fading. 
* Putting both the thresholded data and template match data on the same PCA axis is bad. 
* I had to adjust the aperture calculation; the client seems to be narrow, while the headstage is broad.  why the discrepancy? 
* rather than printing out missed spikes, try labeling them in a different color on the display? (DONE)
* There is something wrong -- the headsdtage is not responding properly nor in time.  Why?
** I wonder if something is loose in there :-/  perhaps the MUX signal is missed? 
** !!Have the mux *reset* every pass through to avoid this. (DONE)
* May be the audio out which is incorrect / delayed whatever.  really should check that.  
** Need to reset the audio buffer when a new client has been found by the bridge. (Done, needs to be checked)
* Really need some algorithm for setting the aperture, based on iteration or so.
** This so that, when looking back over the PCA buffer, there are equal number of false positives and false negatives (or so)
** And the PCA sucks too. Must test with synthetic data.
* First button press of CalcPCA resets the damn thing! WTF. This must be reliable.
** That said, there should be a reset PCA button ... 
* I'm not even sure calcPCA works.  beh.
* Build up distribution of samples, estimate probability of null hypothesis in sorting.
* NEED to record cursor position, target position, everything. 
* Drain no longer works.  (???)
* Need button for sending *all* parameters to the headstage, in the case of a reset (as we've seen)
** Need to have headstage echo, too, so we know it's gotten the parameters. Feedback is everything.
* The adaptive transform is not so good.  Need something fixed! 
** When the monkey is running around, the firing rate is high, which decreases the scale factor; when he stops to drink, the firing rate changes, so the cursor is no longer well controlled. 
* Unchecking connect to gtk client does not disconnect. 
* Cupoje 2 does not close if the pybmi server has gone away.

Mango RHA1 RHA3 RHL2 RHL3. 
Star neurons: 32, 37, 38, 39, 70.
Started at 3:30pm.  
Mango is not playing ... does not recognize the juicer yet, although it appears that he is thirsty. 
@ 5:30 hea realized that there is a juicer in there. 
training on Ch 32, both units a & b.  A is quite strong. 
5:42 transitioned to channels 32 + 37. Does not realize what he's supposed to do.
