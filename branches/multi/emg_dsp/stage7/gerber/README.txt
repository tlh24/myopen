Project: stage7, http://code.google.com/p/myopen/

Layer Stack: 
1 - Front, top of board.  				stage7-Front.gtl
2 - L1, inner layer, ground. 			stage7-Inner2.gbr
3 - L2, inner layer, power/routing. 		stage7-Inner3.gbr
4 - L3, inner layer, power/routing. 		stage7-Inner4.gbr
5 - L4, inner layer, ground. 			stage7-Inner5.gbr
6 - Back, bottom of board.   			stage7-Back.gbl

All layers are viewed from the TOP of the board. 

* PCB to be finished to 0.063" +-0.006" thickness (1.6mm) 
* PCB to be manufactured in accordance with IPC-6011 and IPC-6012 class 2. 
* PCB to be constructed of FR4, high temperature option required, Tg >= 170C
* Routing outline in stage7-Drawings.gbr
	Board external dimensions: 4.20"(y) by 5.88"(x) . 
	Some silkscreen will be cut off board; this is OK. 
* Minimum trace/space 0.005" / 0.005"
* Minimim via drill 0.008"
* Drill file: stage7.drl
* All holes to be plated through.
* Surface finish to be solder mask over bare copper (SMBOC), blue, 
	in stage7-Mask_Front.gts and stage7-Mask_Back.gbs, both sides. 
	with 150 micro inches Nickel (Ni)
	followed by immersion gold. 
* Solder mask may be enlarged as needed.  Currenty 0.0015" over pads.
* Silkcreen in stage7-SilkS_Front.gto , stage7-SilkS_Back.gbo  
	to be white, both sides of board.
