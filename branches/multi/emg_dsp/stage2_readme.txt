Project: stage2

Layer Stack: 
1 - Component, Cmp, top of board.  	stage2-Cmp.pho
2 - L1, inner layer, ground. 		stage2-Inner_L1.pho
3 - L2, inner layer, power/routing. 		""
4 - L3, inner layer, power/routing. 		""
5 - L4, inner layer, power. 			""
6 - Copper, Cop, bottom of board.   	stage2-Cop.pho

Note: all layers are viewed from the TOP of the board. 

* PCB to be finished to 0.065" +- 0.005" thickness, unless otherwise required.  
* PCB to be constructed of FR4, high temperature option not required. 
* Routing outline in stage2-Drawings.pho
* Silkcreen (stage2-SilkS_Cmp.pho (top), stage2-SilkS_Cop.pho (bottom)) 
	to be white or yellow, both sides.
* Drill file: stage2.drl
* Minimum trace/space 0.005" 
* Minimim via drill 0.006"
* Surface finish to be solder mask over bare copper (SMBOC), green, 
	(stage2-Mask_Cmp.pho (top), stage2-Mask_Cop.pho (bottom))
	both sides. 
	with 150 micro inches Nickel (Ni)
	followed by >=1 micro inches immersion gold. 
* Tear dropping alowed where permissible. 
* Via pad removal permissible on inner layers where there is no connection
* PCB to be manufactured in accordance with IPC-6011 and IPC-6012 class 2.
