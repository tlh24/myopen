* Initial import (and open-sourcing) of the emg-dsp design. 
* design is mostly done, just needs some (a lot!) of checking. 
* need to reflow the zones, test DRC.  kicadocaml came up with a few 
	 bits of wire that were not connected (net 0), need to remove. 
* need to add the annotation text to the gerber files to describe how it should
	be manufactured. 
** need to generate & check the drill files, esp. given the two different via sizes. 
* decided to keep the hardware designs in a seperate folder, as I imagine we'll 
	have some software to run on the thing in short time :)
* more later ...
